First of all, please take your time to read the documentation of the asset you downloaded and play a little bit with it. 
After that, please come back here and keep reading. It just will take you a few seconds.



If you like my work and wonder how to support me a little bit more, here are some options for you that would help me a lot to continue working:



1- Rate and comment the asset at the asset store.


2- Buying any other of my paid assets:

3- Donations (PayPal): snicolast81@gmail.com


4- Hiring me, if you are a company that looks for a 3D artist.




Thank you very much for your contribution and help, 


Kind regards,
